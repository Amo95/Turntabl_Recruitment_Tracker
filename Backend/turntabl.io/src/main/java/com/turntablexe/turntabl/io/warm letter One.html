		<p>We’re looking forward to you finally being a part of the team! In a couple of weeks, on Wednesday 16th September our TLC training program will begin at 09:00, and so will your journey with turntabl. We recommend you arrive at least 15 minutes before which will allow you to familiarise yourself with the office and get yourself comfortable. </p>

		<p>The training will be performed at our office at Mile 7, Achimota. A fundamental part of our culture is built during the training, it’s an interactive experience which is far more effective and enjoyable in person. However, if government guidance changes in relation to COVID-19 then we will act accordingly. There will be social distancing as well as sufficient sanitiser available. The full address is:</p>
